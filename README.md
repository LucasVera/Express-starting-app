Express & ES6 REST API Boilerplate
==================================

This is my own starter app for creating express Apps. It uses some of the latest dev techniques and best practices

Ecosystem
---------

- `ES6+` (Babel)
- `CORS`
- `Body Parsing` (body-parser)
- `Sequelize` as ORM (default db is postgres)
- `REST API`
- `Architecture` Controllers + Services
- `Winston` logger
- `Moment` for date management
- `bcrypt` for password encryption
- `dotenv` for handling ENV_VARS
- `Custom Authentication` with JWT + custom encryption using node's crypto module (double keys)
- `ESlint` for code styles
- `nodemon` for live server reloading
- `Docker` support
- `Heroku` deployment support


Application
-----------

This starter app has a Users + BlogPost api to serve a `BlogPosts` and `Users` Database tables as RESTful endpoints. It also has `Authentication` out of the box
