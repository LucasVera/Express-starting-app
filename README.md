This is my own starter app for creating express Apps. It uses some of the latest dev techniques and best practices

- Moment for date management
- bcrypt for password encryption
- dotenv for handling ENV_VARS
- JWT + custom auth with `jsonwebtoken` + crypto module for node (double keys)
- eslint for code styles
- nodemon for live server reloading
- Docker support
- Heroku deployment support
